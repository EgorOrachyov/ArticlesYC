    abstract = "{MOTIVATION: Many computerized methods for RNA secondary structure prediction have been developed. Few of these methods, however, employ an evolutionary model, thus relevant information is often left out from the structure determination. This paper introduces a method which incorporates evolutionary history into RNA secondary structure prediction. The method reported here is based on stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) to give a prior probability distribution of structures. RESULTS: The phylogenetic tree relating the sequences can be found by maximum likelihood (ML) estimation from the model introduced here. The tree is shown to reveal information about the structure, due to mutation patterns. The inclusion of a prior distribution of RNA structures ensures good structure predictions even for a small number of related sequences. Prediction is carried out using maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP) estimation in a Bayesian approach. For small sequence sets, the method performs very well compared to current automated methods.}",

Infernal uses CMs to search for new family members in sequence databases and to create potentially large multiple sequence alignments. Version 1.1 of Infernal introduces a new filter pipeline for RNA homology search based on accelerated profile hidden Markov model (HMM) methods and HMM-banded CM alignment methods. This enables ∼100-fold acceleration over the previous version and ∼10 000-fold acceleration over exhaustive non-filtered CM searches.Availability: Source code, documentation and the benchmark are downloadable from http://infernal.janelia.org.

We call these models ‘covariance models’. A covariance model of tRNA sequences is an extremely sensitive and discriminative tool for searching for additional tRNAs and tRNA-related sequences in sequence databases. A model can be built automatically from an existing sequence alignment. We also describe an algorithm for learning a model and hence a consensus secondary structure from initially unaligned example sequences and no prior structural information. Models trained on unaligned tRNA examples correctly predict tRNA scondary structure and produce high-quality multiple alignments. The approach may be applied to any family of small RNA sequences.}",

Recent methods for predicting RNA secondary structures cover certain classes of pseudoknotted structures, but only a few of them achieve satisfying predictions in terms of both speed and accuracy.Results: We propose IPknot, a novel computational method for predicting RNA secondary structures with pseudoknots based on maximizing expected accuracy of a predicted structure. IPknot decomposes a pseudoknotted structure into a set of pseudoknot-free substructures and approximates a base-pairing probability distribution that considers pseudoknots, leading to the capability of modeling a wide class of pseudoknots and running quite fast. In addition, we propose a heuristic algorithm for refining base-paring probabilities to improve the prediction accuracy of IPknot. The problem of maximizing expected accuracy is solved by using integer programming with threshold cut. We also extend IPknot so that it can predict the consensus secondary structure with pseudoknots when a multiple sequence alignment is given. IPknot is validated through extensive experiments on various datasets, showing that IPknot achieves better prediction accuracy and faster running time as compared with several competitive prediction methods.Availability: The program of IPknot is available at http://www.ncrna.org/software/ipknot/.
