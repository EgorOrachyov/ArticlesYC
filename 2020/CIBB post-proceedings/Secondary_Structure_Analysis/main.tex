\begin{abstract}
A way to combine formal grammars and artificial neural networks for biological sequences processing was recently proposed.
In this approach, an ordinary grammar encodes primitive features of the RNA secondary structure, parsing is utilized for features extraction and artificial neural network~--- for processing of the extracted features.
Parsing is a bottleneck of the solution: input sequences should first be parsed before processing with a trained model which is a time-consuming operation when working with huge biological databases.
In this work, we solve this problem by employing staged learning and limiting parsing to be used only during network training.
We also compare networks which represent the parsing result in two different ways: by a vector and a bitmap image.
Finally, we evaluate our solution on tRNA classification tasks.
