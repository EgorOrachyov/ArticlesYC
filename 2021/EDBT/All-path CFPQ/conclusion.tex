\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
% Two is a number, yeah, but it is hardly a number...
In this paper, we propose a new modifications of Azimov's matrix-based CFPQ algorithm for all-path query semantics. We implement our algorithm using GraphBLAS API and provide the comparation of the most performant linear algebra-based algorithms.

We compare the CPU-based implementation. In the future, we want to obtain GPU-based and distributed implementations which also uses the GraphBLAS API.

Also, further improvements of index creation and path extraction for both matrix-based and Kronecker product-based algorithms are required.
