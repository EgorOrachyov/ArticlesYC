One of the techniques to efficiently solve a data analysis problem is to reduce it to linear algebra operations over vectors and matrices for appropriate values set.
That gives one well studied for years mathematical tools and solutions, as well as the possibility to evaluate this problem with \textit{zero-cost} by linear algebra libraries, which utilize modern hardware, provide various optimization techniques and allow quickly and safely prototype solution in code with predefined building blocks.

Particularly, in graph data analysis such reduction is well presented, since a graph could be 
represented as a matrix and with specially defined \textit{semiring} it could be effectively 
process in linear algebra fashion.
Examples of problems solved in this way are all-pairs shortest path, breadth-first search, maximal independent set problems~\cite{todo}.
Since practical data often come with huge size and sparse form, what is also applicable for graphs, it requires special processing tools for analysis, what appeals to sparse linear algebra libraries.

Boolean algebra allows to address problems over finite set of values, for example, transitive closure of relation, regular and context-free path queries for graphs, parsing for wide classes of languages~\cite{10.5555/972525.972527, OKHOTIN2014101, !!!}.

Huge amount data analysis typically processed as small chunks with the fixed or rarely changed set 
of instructions, what relates to the \textit{single instruction, multiple data} (SIMD) model. 
Although modern CPUs exploit SIMD optimizations, GPGPU gives much more power in such kind data 
processing at cost of implementation challenges. GPGPU programming introduces heterogeneous device 
model into system, memory traffic and data operations limitations, as well as requires to take into
account vendor-specific capabilities. 

At this moment there are presented modern open-source and proprietary sparse linear algebra 
libraries on GPGPU for general operations and common types of values. However, sparse boolean 
linear algebra on GPGPU is still not presented, because of its high specificity. 

In this work, we present the sparse boolean linear algebra operations implementation as stand-alone self-sufficient programming libraries for the two most popular GPGPU platforms: NVIDIA Cuda\footnote{CUDA is a platform and programming model for NVIDIA devices. Home page: \url{https://developer.nvidia.com/CUDA-zone}. Access date: 19.01.2021.}and OpenCL\footnote{OpenCL is an open standard for parallel programming of heterogeneous systems. Home page: \url{https://www.khronos.org/opencl/}. Access date: 19.01.2021.}.
Cuda is a GPGPU technology for NVIDIA devices, which allows to employ some platform-specific facilities, such as unified memory mechanism, and make an architectural assumptions, what gives more optimizations space at cost of portability. 
OpenCL is platform agnostic API standard, which allows to run computations on different platforms, such as multi-threaded CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs.
Our implementation relies on modern sparse matrices processing techniques, as well as exploits some optimizations, related to the boolean data processing.
