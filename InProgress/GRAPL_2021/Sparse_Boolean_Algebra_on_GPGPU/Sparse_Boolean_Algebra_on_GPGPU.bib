abstract = {The computational problem of parsing a sentence in a tree-adjoining language is investigated. An interesting relation is studied between this problem and the well-known computational problem of Boolean matrix multiplication: it is shown that any algorithm for the solution of the former problem can easily be converted into an algorithm for the solution of the latter problem. This result bears on at least two important computational issues. First, we realize that a straightforward method that improves the known upper bound for tree-adjoining grammar parsing is hard to find. Second, we understand which features of the tree-adjoining grammar parsing problem are responsible for the claimed difficulty.},

abstract = "The well-known parsing algorithm for context-free grammars due to Valiant (1975) [25] is analyzed and extended to handle the more general Boolean grammars, which are context-free grammars augmented with conjunction and negation operators in the rules. The algorithm reduces construction of a parsing table to computing multiple products of Boolean matrices of various sizes. Its time complexity on an input string of length n is O(BMM(n)logn), where BMM(n) is the number of operations needed to multiply two Boolean matrices of size n×n, which is O(nω) with ω<2.373 as per the current knowledge. A parse tree can be constructed in time MM(n)logO(1)n (where MM(n) is the complexity of multiplying two integer matrices), by applying a known efficient procedure for determining witnesses for Boolean matrix multiplication. The algorithm has a succinct proof of correctness and is ready to be implemented."
