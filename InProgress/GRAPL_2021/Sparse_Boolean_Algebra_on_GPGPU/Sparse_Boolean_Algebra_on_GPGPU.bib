abstract = {The computational problem of parsing a sentence in a tree-adjoining language is investigated. An interesting relation is studied between this problem and the well-known computational problem of Boolean matrix multiplication: it is shown that any algorithm for the solution of the former problem can easily be converted into an algorithm for the solution of the latter problem. This result bears on at least two important computational issues. First, we realize that a straightforward method that improves the known upper bound for tree-adjoining grammar parsing is hard to find. Second, we understand which features of the tree-adjoining grammar parsing problem are responsible for the claimed difficulty.},

abstract = "The well-known parsing algorithm for context-free grammars due to Valiant (1975) [25] is analyzed and extended to handle the more general Boolean grammars, which are context-free grammars augmented with conjunction and negation operators in the rules. The algorithm reduces construction of a parsing table to computing multiple products of Boolean matrices of various sizes. Its time complexity on an input string of length n is O(BMM(n)logn), where BMM(n) is the number of operations needed to multiply two Boolean matrices of size n×n, which is O(nω) with ω<2.373 as per the current knowledge. A parse tree can be constructed in time MM(n)logO(1)n (where MM(n) is the complexity of multiplying two integer matrices), by applying a known efficient procedure for determining witnesses for Boolean matrix multiplication. The algorithm has a succinct proof of correctness and is ready to be implemented."

abstract = {Identifying similar protein sequences is a core step in many computational biology pipelines such as detection of homologous protein sequences, generation of similarity protein graphs for downstream analysis, functional annotation, and gene location. Performance and scalability of protein similarity search have proven to be a bottleneck in many bioinformatics pipelines due to increase in cheap and abundant sequencing data. This work presents a new distributed-memory software PASTIS. PASTIS relies on sparse matrix computations for efficient identification of possibly similar proteins. We use distributed sparse matrices for scalability and show that the sparse matrix infrastructure is a great fit for protein similarity search when coupled with a fully-distributed dictionary of sequences that allow remote sequence requests to be fulfilled. Our algorithm incorporates the unique bias in amino acid sequence substitution in search without altering basic sparse matrix model, and in turn, achieves ideal scaling up to millions of protein sequences.},

abstract = {Sparse linear algebra is a cornerstone of modern computational science. These algorithms ignore the zero-valued entries found in many domains in order to work on much larger problems at much faster rates than dense algorithms. Nonetheless, optimizing these algorithms is not straightforward. Highly optimized algorithms for multiplying a sparse matrix by a dense vector, for instance, are the subject of a vast corpus of research and can be hundreds of times longer than na\"{\i}ve implementations. Optimized sparse linear algebra libraries are thus needed so that users can build applications without enormous effort.Hardware vendors release proprietary libraries that are highly optimized for their devices, but they limit interoperability and promote vendor lock-in. Open libraries often work across multiple devices and can quickly take advantage of new innovations, but they may not reach peak performance. The goal of this work is to provide a sparse linear algebra library that offers both of these advantages.We thus describe clSPARSE, a permissively licensed open-source sparse linear algebra library that offers state-of-the-art optimized algorithms implemented in OpenCL™. We test clSPARSE on GPUs from AMD and Nvidia and show performance benefits over both the proprietary cuSPARSE library and the open-source ViennaCL library.},

abstract = {Context-free path querying is a technique, which recently gains popularity in many areas, for example, graph databases, bioinformatics, static analysis, etc. In some of these areas, it is often required to query large graphs, and existing algorithms demonstrate a poor performance in this case. The generalization of matrix-based Valiant's context-free language recognition algorithm for graph case is widely considered as a recipe for efficient context-free path querying; however, no progress has been made in this direction so far.We propose the first generalization of matrix-based Valiant's algorithm for context-free path querying. Our generalization does not deliver a truly sub-cubic worst-case complexity algorithm, whose existence still remains a hard open problem in the area. On the other hand, the utilization of matrix operations (such as matrix multiplication) in the process of context-free path query evaluation makes it possible to efficiently apply a wide class of optimizations and computing techniques, such as GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units), parallel processing, sparse matrix representation, distributed-memory computation, etc. Indeed, the evaluation on a set of conventional benchmarks shows, that our algorithm outperforms the existing ones.},
