\section{Conclusion}

Conclusion !!!.

The first direction of the future work is to integrate all parts (OpenCL and Cuda backends) to single library and improve its documentation and prepare to publish. 
Also it is necessary to publish Python package.

Another important step is evaluation of the library on different algorithms and devices.
Namely, algorithms for RPQ and CFPQ should be implemented and evaluated on related data sets.
Also it is necessary to evaluate OpenCL version on FPGA which may require additional technical effort and code changes.

Finally, we plan to discuss with GraphBLAS community possible ways to use our library as backend for GraphBLAST or SuiteSparse in case of Boolean computations.
Moreover, it may be possible to use implemented algorithms as as base for generalization to arbitrary semirings.
