\begin{abstract}
Sparse Boolean matrices are widely applicable in data analysis, and theory of Boolean matrix processing is well-estedlisged and introduces a wide range of different algorithms for basic operations such as matrix-matrix and matrix-vector multiplication, factorization, etc. 
Despite this,
