\section{Conclusion}

Conclusion, current state, results.

Future work. Library extension up to full GraphBLAS API implementation.

LaGraph on F\# .NET.

Evaluation. Comparison with other implementations on different devices.
Manual implementation versus translation.  

Another direction of future work is Brahma.FSharp improvements. 
First of all, it is necessary to support discriminated unions to make it possible to express custom semirings such as \texttt{Min-Plus}, as presented in listing~\ref{lst_example}. 

Also, it is necessary to add high-level abstractions for asynchronous programming, and for multi-GPU programming.
Such mechanisms can be naturally expressed in F\# with native primitives for asynchronous programming.

fusion and other optimizations.
