Graph analysis problems. Not only Graphs. Sparse Linear algebrs. GraphBLAS API

GPGPU for high-performance analysis of huge amount of data. 
GraphBLAST~\cite{!!!} 

High-level programming languages for application develoment vs low-level for high-perfprmance programming.
Moreover, cpecific langiuages for GPGPU programming: CUDA C, OpenCL C.

Portablility of OpenCL.

Type systems. Optimizations. Futhark~\cite{Henriksen:2017:FPF:3062341.3062354}, kernel fusion, etc. 

.NET as a platform. F\#
